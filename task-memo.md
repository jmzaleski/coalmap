Ongoing Tasks

Mapping Task:

Elk Valley Map
Current Coal Mining Operations
Proposed New Coal Mining and Expansion Projects
Water Quality Monitoring Stations

We can start with just the base maps with the current and proposed operations, and I can get you a list of relevant monitoring stations later.

Some examples of maps are below. Something like the first map would be great. Maybe a light and dark version, like what I have for the second example.

Stream Loss Task:

Calculate length or area of stream and habitat loss from coal mining operations
Create reusable code – Python 
Have a value for current mining operations – Total and Individual Mines
Fording River Operation
Greenhills Operation
Line Creek Operation
Elkview Operation
Coal Mountain (decommissioned)
Have a value for stream loss for proposed expansion projects and new operations
Fording River Expansion Project
NWM Coal 
Map illustrating stream/habitat loss

  Fugitive Methane Emissions Task:

Goal will be to calculate the amount of fugitive emissions released during mining operations in the Elk Valley
Collect data from Sentinel-5 satellite
Process and plot on map of the area
Collect methane ground controls

I will get you more information on this shortly…



This is taken from the Ktunaxa’s recent letter to provincial and federal ministers. The Link can be found here … Something like this would be great though. It illustrates current and proposed coal mining operations, but also the map in general is clear enough to show rivers and lakes. It would be ideal to also plot relevant water quality monitoring stations, but this could be done on multiple maps depending on our end goal.

This is another potential usage of the maps.
